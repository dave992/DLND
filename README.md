# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation - Udacity #
In this repository I will commit my progress toward the  [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). I will start the four month term on the 14th of November 2017.

# Projects #
The Nanodegree exists of several courses and five projects.
* __Project 1 -__ Your First Neural Network:
  * _Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day._
* __Project 2 -__ Dog-Breed Classifier:
  * _Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this modelâ€”this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications._
* __Project 3 -__ Generate TV Scripts:
  * _Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts._
* __Project 4 -__ Generate Faces:
  * _Build a pair of Multi-Layer Neural Networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!_
* __Project 5 -__ Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly:
  * _Design a deep reinforcement learning agent to control several quadcopter flying tasks, including take-off, hover, and landing._
